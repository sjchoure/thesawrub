*Location: Boston, MA*  
*Duration: Febuary 2023 - Present*

- Working under the guidance of MIT Prof. Connor W. Coley’s (Forbes 30 Under 30 Healthcare) research lab and collaborated
with the MIT Corporate Consortium (10+ Companies) for Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis
(MLPDS) to develop innovative AI-assisted tools and algorithms that are used by multiple pharmaceutical companies.
- Lead the complete re-design of frontend using Nuxt.js from scratch with many other utilities and helped to make them open
source. Developed complete CI/CD pipeline on Gitlab, enabling automated deployments and testing of the tool.
- Employed advanced optimization techniques leveraging PyTorch libraries to fine-tune model hyperparameters and
implement sophisticated data preprocessing methods. The systematic optimization efforts resulted in a substantial
enhancement of model accuracy and a noticeable reduction in training times.
- Containerization helped to increase scalability by creating multiple replicas of the application and ensured load-balancing by
using hybrid algorithm. Converted time consuming endpoints to asynchronous using celery workers and RabbitMQ.
- Added platform observability tools such as cAdivsor, Prometheus, and Grafana to watch container metrics at regular intervals
and alert on PagerDuty for any anomalies. Helping get better insights on P99 latencies and ways to reduce them.

*Location: Menlo Park, CA*  
*Duration: May 2022 - August 2022*

- Creation of Policy Management Tool to manage User’s Special Category Data (SCD), which helped in filtering out certain
user’s data based on their district such as GDPR for EU.
- Logging if a particular user impression is sensitive or not for a particular policy by collecting data from all the Facebook apps
and thus helping the team to roll out features ahead of time.
- Implementing features such as ability to mutate policy’s information and status along with keeping track of timestamps and
engineer’s information making the change. Visualizing those changes live using Gantt Chart.
- Reduced manual effort by creating continuous integration/deployment framework to validate configuration file changes
upon mutation. Also, unit test and end to end test both in frontend (React) and backend (PHP).
